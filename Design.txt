This implementation uses a class Indexer to encapsulate the code.
The constructor initializes the instance variables for the pages, exclude words file, results file, exclude words list and results dictionary.

There are three methods in the class Indexer.

The read_exclude_words method reads the exclude words from the file.

The clean_data method removes the unnecessary characters and returns a cleaned list of words.

The index_of_words method reads the exclude words, iterates over each page, reads its contents, cleans the data using the help of clean_data method, and creates a dictionary with each word and its corresponding page numbers. The dictionary is then sorted, and the results are written to a file.

Finally, if __name__ == '__main__': block initializes an instance of the Indexer class and calls the index_of_words method.
